This script allows you to fetch from a PHP script every email that have bounced from Amazon to your Gmail account.
NEW: Now also handles complaints

Requirements:
php_imap extension
IMAP enabled on your Gmail account


The example.php should be pretty straight forward.

Basically, you connect to gmail using your IMAP credentials.
You set a label if needed.
And then you fetch all the emails that have been bounced back by Amazon.


If you need it for other bounces then Amazon, it is very easy to change. (line 72 of AmazonSESBounces.php).
