Basically, you connect to gmail using your IMAP credentials (IMAP must be enabled on Gmail).
You set a label if needed.
And then you fetch all the emails that have been bounced back by Amazon.


If you need it for other bounces then Amazon, it is very easy to change. (line 72 of AmazonSESBounces.php).
